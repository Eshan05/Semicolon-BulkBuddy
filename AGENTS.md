The Group-Buying Hack: "BulkBuddy" (Aggregator for SMEs)
The B2B Problem: Small manufacturers (e.g., a local bottle cap maker) buy raw materials (plastic, steel) in small quantities, so they pay high "retail" prices. Big corporations get huge discounts because they buy in bulk. The Solution: A platform that groups geographically close SMEs together to place one single bulk order for raw materials.

How it works:

Factory A needs 200kg of Steel. Factory B needs 300kg.

The app groups them into a "Pool" until it hits 1 Ton (the bulk threshold).

Once the target is hit, the order is placed automatically at the discounted rate.

The "Hack": Dynamic Pricing Engine. As more people join the pool, the price-per-kg drops in real-time on the dashboard (Gamification for B2B).
