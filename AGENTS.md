The Group-Buying Hack: "BulkBuddy" (Aggregator for SMEs)
The B2B Problem: Small manufacturers (EX: Local bottle cap maker) buy raw materials (Plastic, Steel) in small quantities, so they pay high retail prices. Big corporations get huge discounts because they buy in bulk. The Solution: A platform that groups geographically close SMEs together to place one single bulk order for raw materials.

How it works:

- Factory A needs 200kg of Steel. Factory B needs 300kg.
- The app groups them into a "Pool" until it hits 1 Ton (the bulk threshold).
- Once the target is hit, the order is placed automatically at the discounted rate.
- The "Hack": Dynamic Pricing Engine. As more people join the pool, the price-per-kg drops in real-time on the dashboard (Gamification for B2B).

# Idea

Imagine a flow like this (VERY BASIC):

- Buyer will put up a pool, mentioning a supplier which may or may not be on the platform. Let's say at 100% they get a discount, but their requirements is only till 60%
- Others can join in
- Let's say another joins and now it's 85%. The two can chat in the pool room. Look at each other's profile. The other company may filter by location (Close / Remote / Another branch)
- Let's say a third comes in but they want more. Now either they can take 15% and start a new pool with the other stuff or put it up all and make it say, 150%
- Now a supplier who *is* on the platform can see this pool and think that if they go up to 160% I can give them all a much better deal, so he can join the pool chat as a supplier
- The four can discuss on the platform on how to up it to 160% or not. Then if the deal gets finalized they can pay that supplier.
- Win-win

## Gamification & Engagement Tweaks

- Pool Streaks & Badges — Reward consistent participants: "3 Pools in a Row" → "Reliable Pooler" badge (Profile). Or "Pool Closer" for users who join pools near threshold and help close them. Boosts repeat usage without complex points systems.
- Progress Milestones Notifications — Beyond real-time % bar: Push alerts like "Pool @92% — Just 80kg for 8% discount!" or "You're the one who pushed us over 100% — Thanks!" Creates emotional highs and FOMO.
- Referral Bonuses — "Invite another SME to join a pool and get an extra 2% off your next order!" Encourages organic growth and leverages network effects among local businesses.
- Daily/Weekly Pool Challenges (Later)

## Trust & Transparency Enhancements

- Profile "Trust Score" (Basic)
- Anonymous Mode for Sensitive Specs
- Post-Pool "Vibe Check" Quick Ratings — Simple 3-question survey after deal closes: "Specs matched?" "Chat helpful?" "Would pool again?" Feeds into trust scores and helps filter bad actors early.

- One-Click Pool Sharing: Allow users to generate a shareable link or QR code for a pool, auto-postable to WhatsApp groups or local SME forums
- Supplier Bid Auto-Comparison: When multiple suppliers join a pool chat, auto-generate a side-by-side table in the dashboard
- Connect with a buyer or supplier or admin in chat
- Soft commitments so they won't back out last-second or ghost.
- Always allow buyers to contact amongst themselves
- Spec Mismatches in Pools: Buyers might join with slightly different requirements (e.g., one needs virgin HDPE, another recycled), causing disputes or pool splits. We can use AI to show compatibility, or have partial pools with adjusted pricing.
- Always verify both buyer and signups. When they put their onboarding details it will go to an admin verification queue. Whereby, the admin will read their details, documents and so on then only they will be allowed on the platform

- If oversubscription happens and supplier can't fulfil excess then should send notification to other suppliers.  
- Edge Case: Supplier-Buyer Collusion: A supplier and buyer fake-join to manipulate prices for others. Why it matters: Undermines fairness. Mitigation: Audit logs and AI flagging unusual patterns

VERY IMPORTANT: For now it will be single point of contact, AKA one company only have one account, not a proper organization system. Company name / branch should be unique
